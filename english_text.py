        "All the next examples will happen inside of a plane:\n     A plane is a flat, two dimensional surface that extends infinitely far",
        "     A plane is represented by an XOY coordinate system. OX is the horizontal axis. OY is the vertical",
        "A point is an exact location. It has no size, only a position inside the plane",
        "We have drawn three points and marked them as A, B and C",
        "Each point has a coordinate inside the plane",
        "For example B's coordinates are: -6 on the OX and +2 on the OY",
        "That can be written B(-6,2)",
        "What are the approximate coordinates of B and C?",
        "                               LINES",
        "A line can be defined as a straight one-dimensional figure that has no thickness and extends endlessly in both directions.\nIt is often described as the shortest distance between any two points.",
        "We have drawn several lines.\nOnly one line can be drawn between two distinct points A and B!\nWe can write the lines as AB, CD or ED (we name two points on the line)",
        "In relation between themselves, the lines can be:",
        " - Parallel: they never meet, they are always the same distance apart\n        In our example the lines AB and CD are parallel",
        " - Intersecting: if the two lines are not parallel, it means that they intersect\n       Two distinct lines always intersect in only one point",
        " - Perpendicular: a special case where the angle between two intersecting lines is 90 degrees:\n       In our example EF is perpendicular to AB. What about CD?",
        "                               Euclid's Parallel Postulate",
        "Euclid was an ancient Greek mathematician who is considered the founder of geometry.\n     He lived in the city of Alexandria in the 3rd century BC. Where is Alexandria on the map?",
        "A postulate or an axiom is something that is considered to be true without needing a proof.\nIt is used as a starting point for further reasoning.",
        "In this case it is considered the starting point of geometry. That is why it is also called: Euclidean Geometry",
        "Given a line and any point A on it, we may consider A as decomposing this line into two parts. Each such part is called a ray (or half-line) and the point A is called its initial point",
